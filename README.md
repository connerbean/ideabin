Idea bin is a one stop spot for creators and the ideas that they come across on a day to day basis. 

Users can input their ideas and click and drag them in whichever order they prefer, usually ranked from most preferred to least. Eventually, users will be able to subsribe to other users ideas, follow progress updates, make their ideas public/private, and share their best ideas on social media.  

Idea.bin will use a backend built upon Go and expose an API in which ReactJS will use to create a versatile and reactive UI.
